SwiftToDoList
=============

Apple's ToDoList tutorial using Swift

+++++++++++++

This code is a successful attempt at using only Apple's new SWIFT programming language to implement the apple's To-Do List tutorial.
I checked a lot online, and it was mentioned in few tutorials that storyboard/Interface Builder could connect the cancel/delete button to 
unwindToList method & we would need to add Objective header file to make it happen, but when I tried in my example, I was able to make it work.

Let me know if I did anything wrong or if you have any questions.
